# What is Slot
Slot is a cross-platform command based text editor which main priorities are - minimalistic yet modern UI that reduces the cognitive load while working, streamlined UX, integrated command line with quick access to all editor's functions, easy extensibility with new highlighting schemes, autocomplete and folding strategies, etc. At its core Slot is a completely safe managed application written in 100% C# with no API calls; the same Slot binaries can run under Windows (.NET or Mono), Linux and Mac OS (Mono). Slot uses an in-house developed text editing engine with lots of advanced features such as syntax highlighting, folding, multiple carets and selections, configurable word wrapping modes, soft and hard tabs, multi-level undo and redo, and much more. Slot was inspired by such editors as ViM, Atom, VSCode, and Zed.
